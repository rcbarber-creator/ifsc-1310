  <h1>Gordo</h1>
  <h2>Old Reliable</h2>

  <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's <qspaceprogram></qspaceprogram>.<em>Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.</p>
<p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space.</p><p>Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
