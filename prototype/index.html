  <h1>Gordo</h1>
  <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
  <p id="Content">Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's <q>space program</q>. <em>Eight</em> monkeys had flown on NASA Missions before him,five of whom went by the name of Albert.<sup><a href="#footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Gordo's historic flight</strong> took place on December 13, 1958> when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space.</p><p>Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>

<h3>The Mission</h3>

<p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing</p><p>in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."</p>
<p>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut</p>
<h4>The Jupiter AM-13</h4>
<p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of</p><p>the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>
<p>Flight Date: December 13, 1958</p><p>Launch Time: 03.53 EST</p>
<h5> The Journey</h5>
<p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the </p><p>outstanding achievements of space research.</p>
<p>Flight Time: 15 Minutes</p>
<p>Apogee: 310 Miles</p>
